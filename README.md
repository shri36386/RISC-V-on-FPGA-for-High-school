  <summary><h2>INTRODUCTION TO RISC-V</h2> </summary>
RISCV

  * RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
  * RISC V is a open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) used for designing computer processors.
  * A CPU requires instructions to function. RISC V is a set of basic nstructions a processor can understand.

ISA

* It is the formal interface between a computer software and Hardware. To run a software application on any hardware, there must exist a way to communicate between the two. The ISA makes this communication possible.
* It defines the set of machine instructions a processor can excecute along with rules for -
  1. How to operate on data
  2. How to access memory
  3. How to manage registers
  4. How to control program flow.
